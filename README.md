# Simba scripts
[Simba](http://wizzup.org/simba/) is an automation program for repeating complicated tasks by finding and reading colours on the screen, and simulating the mouse and key board. Simba scripts are written in a scripting language which is a limited subset of Pascal. Simba, together with the [SRL Resource Library](https://github.com/SRL/SRL), is primarily used to automate the MMORPG RuneScape.

My first experiences programming were with Simba and SRL. In this repository, I have collected some of the scripts I published on the [SRL-Forum](http://villavu.com).


## Divination
This is my magnum opus, as far as SRL/Simba is concerned. This script covered an entire skill, and could be used from level 1 all the way to 99, or to farm gold. The forum thread for this script is the 34th most-viewed thread of all time on the SRL Forums. Many of the screenshots of the "progress reports" (Run time, experience points gained painted on the game screen) have been lost to time as once-popular imaging hosting sites have gone down or otherwise broken links to images, and only a minority of users would have posted a screenshot. And, I stupidly published the final version that would have been downloaded the most as raw text in a comment, instead of a file attachment which tracks the number of downloads. 

But, based on the screenshots still available on the forum thread, and the number of views on the thread (135,000), I estimate that this script has been run in total for at least 350,000 hours (2500+ downloads &rarr; ~700 heavy users * 500 hours per heavy user (conservative estimate from my own use time of several thousand hours)), earning at least 17.5 billion RuneScape gold pieces, enough to stock dozens of players with all the best gear in the game, or around $15,000 in real world value if illicitly sold to other players for cash. None of my accounts running this script were banned.

## Other
I wrote dozens of scripts for SRL. But these are the ones that got more than a couple people using it, so the others probably aren't worth sharing in the current year.
